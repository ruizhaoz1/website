            <dt>What is Loopring?</dt>
            <dd>Loopring is providing traders, participants and institutions with a decentralized automated trade execution system that intelligently implements their trades across the world's crypto exchanges, shielding them from counterparty risk and reducing their costs of trading.  </dd>
            <dd>Loopring intermediates trust between blockchains and exchanges, allowing trading members to retain custody of their funds. For ERC20 tokens initially.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Can we create an exchange based on Loopring? How to make profit?</dt>
            <dd>Loopring is an open sourced protocol, not an exchange. Any entity under this protocol can participate with order matching.</dd>
            <dd>
              There are two types of Loopring exchange service fees from order matching system: transaction fee and “ring-matching cost saving” fee. In order to motivate order matching at the best price, “ring-matching cost saving“ fee will be the mainstream income.</dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Is Loopring only for ETH blockchain?</dt>
            <dd>Loopring intermediates trust between blockchains and exchanges, allowing trading members to retain custody of their funds. It is for ERC20 tokens initially but eventually will be across all blockchains.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Will Loopring issue a token?</dt>
            <dd>Loopring operates using a crypto economic protocol, mediated by the Loopring Token (LRC), a cryptographic token that provides membership access and is used to pay trading fees. Higher balances of LRC allow members access to preferential liquidity treatment and discounted trading. LRC will be an Ethereum (ERC20) tradable asset. Tokens will be sold to members initially in a token auction, and then after launch on an ongoing basis.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Is Loopring exchange safer than decentralized exchanges?</dt>
            <dd>Loopring provides pure trustless atomic swaps in settlement of orders and mediates risk between its members and the markets. All transactions clearing and settlement are completed through smart contract on the blockchain. Since, Loopring has minimize the trading risk to zero.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Does Loopring take market price orders?</dt>
            <dd>Loopring will not take any market price orders at this early stage, because market price orders are prioritized by the placement time. However, due to Loopring’s decentralized mechanism and its attributes, order will not be prioritized by the time.</dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>How to prevent ring-matching being stolen on the blockchain?</dt>
            <dd>Under Loopring mechanism, traders' funds remain under their control in a decentralized smart contract on the blockchain.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Does Loopring support order partially match? Would the matched order be canceled or reversed?</dt>
            <dd>Loopring can break order into small pieces, identifies the best exchanges and times to trade those pieces on, and applies game theoretic logic to optimize trading results.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl>
            <dt>Why an order can be mix-matched with several exchanges?</dt>
            <dd>Sending Order actually is a command. Sender will broadcast this order to all Loopring’s exchanges in order to partially or fully execute the order, because all the tokens are still kept in the user’s blockchain address during the exchanging process. Transaction clearing and settlement are done within the smart contract.</dd>

            <dt>When to start Token Sale?</dt>
            <dd>We are planning 30 days crowd sale, starting from the August 1,2017. The detailed token launch mechanism is being designed collaboratively with community. If you are interesting in helping to shape our thinking around the token launch or any aspect of our design,please contact: <a href="mailto:foundation@loopring.org">foundation@loopring.org</a>
